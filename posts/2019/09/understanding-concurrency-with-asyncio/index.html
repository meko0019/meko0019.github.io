<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I/O is slow. In fact, in most cases, it&rsquo;s orders of magnitude slower than anything else your program is doing. And that can cause a program that executes sequentially to waste a lot of resources waiting on high latency i/o. A common example of this is a network operation. In the example below, the program is blocked from continuing its flow of execution until the https request is completed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f00">import</span> requests

resp = requests.get(<span style="color:#87ceeb">&#39;https://www.example.com/&#39;</span>)
<span style="color:#0f0"># program is blocked here until request is completed</span>

<span style="color:#f00">print</span>(resp.status_code)</code></pre></div>
<p>This post is an attempt at understanding how Python3&rsquo;s <code>asyncio</code> tackles this problem using concurrency. There&rsquo;s multiple ways to minimize the execution time of such programs, by allowing them to execute other tasks while waiting for the request to respond. And they generally fall into two major categories: concurrency and parallelism. You can think of concurrency as dealing with multiple things at the same time and parallelism <em>doing</em> multiple things at the same time. The former has overlapping time periods of execution while the latter does simultaneous execution. There are tons of articles and blog posts about this so I won&rsquo;t go into detail here. Parallelism is implemented in Python with the <code>multiprocessing</code> module and concurrency with <code>threading</code> and <code>asyncio</code>.</p>

<p>I find asyncio&rsquo;s design particularly interesting because multiprocessing and multithreading have large resource overheads while asyncio is a single-threaded, single-process design which uses cooperative multitasking. In cooperative multitasking, tasks yield to the scheduler as opposed to preemptive multitasking where the scheduler interrupts tasks. If you want to know how asyncio works under the hood, you can check out <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-web-crawler-with-asyncio-coroutines.html" target="_blank">this detailed article</a> written by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis and Guido van Rossum, and <a href="https://snarky.ca/how-the-heck-does-async-await-work-in-python-3-5/" target="_blank">another one</a> by Brett Cannon.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>The <code>asyncio</code> module provides tools for building concurrent applications using an event loop and coroutines. Coroutines are functions that can be suspended and resumed while being executed. On <em>await</em> they release control back to the event loop. The event loop schedules concurrent tasks and manages their execution. Let&rsquo;s have a look at a simple example to illustrate how this pattern can be implemented at a high level:</p>

<p>The first thing to note here is that when we run the tasks asynchronously, even though we&rsquo;re starting all of the tasks at the same time the order of execution and completion depend on the random number of seconds in each coroutine, i.e. the latency of i/o in each coroutine. The second (and more important) thing to note is that when running sequentially, the process took at least as much time as all 10 tasks combined while in asynchronous execution the process took about as long as the slowest task. As the number of tasks increases, running them asynchronously becomes exponentially faster. To demonstrate this, let&rsquo;s run the same function and coroutine using 100 tasks, while reducing the sleep time by a factor of 10.</p>

<p>As we can see, the speedup is even greater with more tasks. About 5x when running 10 tasks vs 46x when running 100. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that at really high numbers of tasks, the &lsquo;process time&rsquo; of the program will actually be higher than the longest running task because of context switching. Nonetheless, the asynchronous program will still be much faster.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this post. Some key things to keep in mind as you code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to be executed</li>
<li>Everything you call from a coroutine should be non blocking or else you risk stalling the entire system. e.g. avoid doing large computations, or blocking network calls</li>
<li>asyncio does not magically make things non-blocking. You have explicitly yield to the event loop where i/o is performed</li>
</ul>
