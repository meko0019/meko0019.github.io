      <description>Python&amp;rsquo;s asyncio library provides tools for writing high-performance concurrent code using the async/await syntax. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll explore asynchronous programming by building a lightweight alternative to Logstash, a data processing pipeline that ingests data from different sources, transforms it, and then sends it to a data stash. The pipeline will run in a docker container using the sidecar pattern. It&amp;rsquo;ll fetch data (container logs) from a running container, structure it using regular expressions, and ship it to an Elasticsearch instance.</description>

      <description>Introduction I/O is slow. In fact, in most cases, it&amp;rsquo;s orders of magnitude slower than anything else your program is doing. And that can cause a program that executes sequentially to waste a lot of resources waiting on high latency i/o. A common example of this is a network operation. In the example below, the program is blocked from continuing its flow of execution until the https request is completed.</description>
